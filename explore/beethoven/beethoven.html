			<p>Beethoven was born in Bonn. His musical talent was obvious at an early age, and he was initially harshly and intensively taught by his father Johann van Beethoven.
			He was later taught by the composer and conductor Christian Gottlob Neefe, under whose tuition he published his first work, a set of keyboard variations, in 1783.
			He found relief from a dysfunctional home life with the family of Helene von Breuning, whose children he loved, befriended, and taught piano. At age 21, he moved to
			Vienna, which subsequently became his base, and studied composition with Haydn. Beethoven then gained a reputation as a virtuoso pianist, and he was soon courted by
			Karl Alois, Prince Lichnowsky for compositions, which resulted in his three Opus 1 piano trios (the earliest works to which he accorded an opus number) in 1795.</p>

			<p>His first major orchestral work, the First Symphony, appeared in 1800, and his first set of string quartets was published in 1801. During this period, his hearing began
			to deteriorate, but he continued to conduct, premiering his Third and Fifth Symphonies in 1804 and 1808, respectively. His Violin Concerto appeared in 1806. His last piano
			concerto (No. 5, Op. 73, known as the 'Emperor'), dedicated to his frequent patron Archduke Rudolf of Austria, was premiered in 1810, but not with Beethoven as soloist.
			He was almost completely deaf by 1814, and he then gave up performing and appearing in public.</p>

			<p>Beethoven died on 26 March 1827 at the age of 56; only his friend Anselm H체ttenbrenner and a "Frau van Beethoven" (possibly his old enemy Johanna van Beethoven) were present.
			According to H체ttenbrenner, at about 5 in the afternoon there was a flash of lightning and a clap of thunder: "Beethoven opened his eyes, lifted his right hand and looked up for
			several seconds with his fist clenched ... not another breath, not a heartbeat more."Many visitors came to the death-bed; some locks of the dead man's hair were retained by
			H체ttenbrenner and Hiller, amongst others.An autopsy revealed Beethoven suffered from significant liver damage, which may have been due to his heavy alcohol consumption,
			and also considerable dilation of the auditory and other related nerves.</p>

			<p>Beethoven's funeral procession in Vienna on 29 March 1827 was attended by an estimated 10,000 people.Franz Schubert and the violinist Joseph Mayseder were among the torchbearers.
			A funeral oration by the poet Franz Grillparzer was read. Beethoven was buried in the W채hring cemetery, north-west of Vienna, after a requiem mass at the church of the Holy Trinity
			(Dreifaltigkeitskirche) in Alserstrasse. Beethoven's remains were exhumed for study in 1863, and moved in 1888 to Vienna's Zentralfriedhof where they were reinterred in a grave adjacent
			to that of Schubert.</p>
